Manjaro Awesome WM Respin
=========================

Manjaro Awesome WM Respin - codenamed Cesious - is a respin and Community
Edition of [Manjaro Linux](http://manjaro.org/). Instead of using a general
Desktop Environment, it uses the very powerful dynamic tiling window manager
[Awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/). This respin is mainly targetted at
people who are new to tiling WMs, or experienced people who want to have a
fully functional system after the installation.

This respin will follow the same numbering system as the official Manjaro Linux
versions. The core is completely the same as the official Manjaro Linux
releases, so it should work just the same. Although - as with each Linux
distribution - you still have to pay attention while installing, I'm not
responsible for any mistakes.

As usual, you can stay up to date with a simple pacman command. It might also
be a good idea to take a look at the changelog here sometimes, as new
applications are added and certain configuration files might get improved over
time.

If you have any question regarding this respin or if you have feedback to keep
improving with each release, then you can visit the [official forum
thread](https://forum.manjaro.org/index.php?topic=7315.0) of this respin on the
Manjaro Linux Forums.
